0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in the given dictionary,
    It means lung disease caused by inhaling fine ash and sand dust. 
1.  getrusage returns resource usage for the first argument and stores this into the second
    argument which must be of type struct rusage.
2.  Sixteen members are in struct rusage.
3.  Calculate uses the before and after variables to find the time taken to run a function.
4.  First, speller loads in the dictionary and opens the text file. In order to spell check 
    the file, speller iterates through each letter in the file using fgetc(fp) where fp
    represents the file. speller uses fgetc() to find the value of the char that the file's
    position indicator is on. It then stores the value of fgetc() to check for its value.
    If the value is valid (it's a letter or apotrophe) then it is saved into a temporary
    storage array called word. If a number is found, the word is ignored and the temporary
    storage is prepared to be overwritten.The program continues to iterate through the 
    letters in the file untill no alphanumeric values can be found. If this is true and
    there is information in the variable word[] then it is assumed that the word is done
    and a "\0" is added to the end of it. The program then spell checks the word and if the
    word was spelled wrong, the program increments misspelling and prints the misspelled 
    word. The program then prepares word[] for overwriting so a new word can be loaded in 
    and checked.
5.  fscanf wouldn't allow the checking of every letter to make sure the word has only 
    valid characters.
6.  const char* is used to prevent any changes from happening to the word or the dictionary
7.  I used a hash table made of linked lists. In each node of the list I put a word from the
    dictionary
8.  0.6 milliseconds
9.  I removed some unescessary loops to slightly improve the speed to 0.5 milliseconds
10. Load took the most of the run time.
